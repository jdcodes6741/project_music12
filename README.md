User Story: Music is the universal language of mankind. As an avid music lover, I love listening to all types of music, especially in different languages. Music is universal and you don’t really need to understand the lyrics to a song in order to like it. Most of the time, songs are in English and I still don’t understand the lyrics. Globally, songs that are in different languages has been growing in popularity. Universal Music is an app that introduces users to top 50 songs from G20 countries.
